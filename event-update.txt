overall farming tools reduced by 2.53125 x lvl14 (65% less)
overall tools reduced by 2.53125 x lvl14 (46% less)

barrel lvl10 no longer worth it, recommend barrel lvl9.
    you'll still make twice as much wood as you need on the way.
toolbox lvl9 no longer worth it, recommend toolbox lvl8.
    no extra copper armour taps needed besides for armour objectives.
    rivets now needed twice as much as tools (and their energy cost is the same for all toolbox levels)
    each rivet ad is worth 16.7 energy.
